# Skills to Evidence Matrix

Use this matrix to present capabilities in a way that is easy for recruiters, hiring managers, and technical leaders to evaluate quickly.

## Capability Matrix

| Capability Area | What I Built | Evidence Artifact In This Repo | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI System Architecture | Multi-stage orchestration pipeline with routing, retrieval, validation, and provenance | `docs/SYSTEMS-ARCHITECTURE.md` | Shows system-level engineering depth |
| LLM Operations | Dynamic model/provider routing with fallback strategy | `docs/SYSTEMS-ARCHITECTURE.md` | Demonstrates reliability and cost awareness |
| Retrieval Design | Retrieval + context assembly workflow | `docs/SYSTEMS-ARCHITECTURE.md` | Proves grounding and relevance handling |
| Output Reliability | Structured output contracts and schema validation gates | `docs/SYSTEMS-ARCHITECTURE.md` | Enables deterministic downstream integrations |
| Explainability | Provenance metadata strategy | `docs/SYSTEMS-ARCHITECTURE.md` | Builds trust and auditability |
| Product Execution | Ability to convert ambiguous workflows into production architecture | Case studies authored with `docs/CASE-STUDY-TEMPLATE.md` | Shows execution, not just prototyping |
| Security/Privacy Judgment | Explicit redaction and publication guardrails | `docs/PRIVACY_IP_GUARDRAILS.md` | Signals mature engineering and risk control |

## Role-Aligned Interpretation

### AI Engineer

Look for:
- orchestration quality
- model routing decisions
- structured output reliability
- observability patterns

Primary proof:
- `docs/SYSTEMS-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- case studies using `docs/CASE-STUDY-TEMPLATE.md`

### Systems Architect

Look for:
- decomposition quality
- failure handling strategy
- reliability and scaling mindset
- component contract clarity

Primary proof:
- `docs/SYSTEMS-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/PORTFOLIO_EXTRACTION_PLAYBOOK.md`

### Product/Design-Focused AI Builder

Look for:
- conversion of domain problems into clear workflow stages
- decision framing and tradeoff communication
- measurable outcomes tied to user value

Primary proof:
- case studies using `docs/CASE-STUDY-TEMPLATE.md`

### Domain/Knowledge Work Integrator

Look for:
- provenance and traceability
- structured outputs compatible with review-heavy workflows
- safe handling of sensitive context

Primary proof:
- `docs/SYSTEMS-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/PRIVACY_IP_GUARDRAILS.md`

## Evidence Quality Standard

Each published claim should include:
- scope: what you directly owned
- method: how it was implemented
- verification: metric, before/after, or observed operational impact
- limits: where tradeoffs remained
