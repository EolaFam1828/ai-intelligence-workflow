# AI Intelligence Workflow

Public-facing portfolio documentation of a production-grade TypeScript AI platform for:
- multi-model LLM routing
- retrieval and context orchestration
- structured outputs
- provenance and traceability

This repository is intentionally sanitized. It is designed to show technical depth and execution quality without exposing domain-sensitive context, private source code, client information, or proprietary platform IP.

## Repository Approach

This repository focuses on:
- architecture decisions and system decomposition
- reliability, validation, and fallback patterns
- traceability and structured output contracts
- measurable outcomes with explicit scope and limits

## Portfolio Contents

- [`docs/SYSTEMS-ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/SYSTEMS-ARCHITECTURE.md): sanitized architecture and orchestration flow
- [`docs/SKILLS-EVIDENCE-MATRIX.md`](docs/SKILLS-EVIDENCE-MATRIX.md): capability-to-proof mapping for hiring evaluation
- [`docs/CASE-STUDY-TEMPLATE.md`](docs/CASE-STUDY-TEMPLATE.md): truth-first template for publishing project case studies
- [`docs/PORTFOLIO_EXTRACTION_PLAYBOOK.md`](docs/PORTFOLIO_EXTRACTION_PLAYBOOK.md): process for extracting publishable artifacts from a private codebase
- [`docs/PRIVACY_IP_GUARDRAILS.md`](docs/PRIVACY_IP_GUARDRAILS.md): rules for privacy, confidentiality, and IP protection
- [`scripts/sanity_check_portfolio.sh`](scripts/sanity_check_portfolio.sh): local scan for sensitive wording and secret patterns

## Core Platform Elements

Core platform capabilities documented here:
- intelligent model routing based on task profile and quality/cost constraints
- retrieval workflows with explicit context assembly and ranking
- structured JSON contracts for downstream reliability
- provenance chain for answer confidence and source traceability
- fallback and retry patterns for resilient execution
- instrumentation hooks for runtime observability

## Evidence Standard

Everything published in this repo should be:
- accurate
- evidence-backed
- scoped (what was built by me vs team)
- non-speculative

If a metric cannot be verified, it should not be claimed.

## How To Use This Repo

1. Start at the architecture doc to understand system thinking.
2. Use the skills matrix to map capability to role requirements.
3. Publish 2 to 4 sanitized case studies using the template.
4. Copy `.portfolio-sensitive-terms.example.txt` to `.portfolio-sensitive-terms.txt` and add your own private terminology patterns.
5. Run the portfolio sanity check before each public update.

## Notes

This repo is the public narrative layer. It does not contain proprietary implementation details from the private source repository.
